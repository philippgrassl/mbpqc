# Machine-Readable Measurement Data

The data in this repository is described in the paper:

_Grassl, P.; Hudler, M.; Koschuch, M.: "Examining the Runtime and Memory Consumption of Post-Quantum Cryptography Algorithms for Resource-Constrained Devices"_


The files in the directory `Measurements` contain one algorithm measurement each and the file `Collection.json` contains a collection of all measurements (basically the combination of all files in the `Measurements` directory).
